   This means Xsnow is available freely and you may give it to other
   people as is, but I retain all rights. Therefore it does not classify
   as 'Public Domain' software. It *is* allowed to package Xsnow for
   Unix/Linux distributions, CD-Roms etc, and to make the necessary
   changes to makefiles etc. to facilitate this.

   Permission to use and distribute Robin Hogan's toon_root.c under the terms
   of the xsnow license when used as part of xsnow has been obtained.
